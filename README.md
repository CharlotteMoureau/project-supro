# Project-Supro

This was a group project (made with [Asceline Hogge](https://github.com/AscelineHogge), [Charlotte Moureau](https://github.com/CharlotteMoureau) and [François Royen](https://github.com/francoisRoyen)) carried from the 25th of January to the 2nd of February 2021 as part of the BeCode Liège's Junior Web Developer programm. We were tasked to make a website for a fake client "John Lafrite". The client gave us a strict design to follow for his [e-commerce website](https://francoisroyen.github.io/project-supro/), but gave us free range for the animations.

## Learning objectives

- [ ] consolidate our knowledge in git, HTML, CSS, Sass
- [ ] Respect strictly a given design
- [ ] Working in a team
- [ ] Respect the deadline

## The mission:

Code the front-end (whithout JavaScript) of those pages:

- Homepage
- Shop page
- Single product page
- About page
- Contact page

The pictures were given to us by the client and we also had to make the pages responsive.

## Instructions:

- The style guide must be stricly observed (Your futur missions with John Lafrite depend on it).
- The website will be responsive.
- In tablet and mobile, there must be a menu hamburger.
- The website have to respond to the w3c norms.
- Pay attention to SEO.
- Install the Google's extension Lighthouse in your browser and when your website is done, active it to see your scores.
- Think about nice hover effects.
- NO BUG, everything must work.
- Respect the timeline. If not, at least the Homepage, Shop and Single product has to be completed (it's the most important for the client).
- Everybody in the team must code.

### Style guide:

Font : Roboto -> download on Google fonts

Colors

- black : #222
- grey : #999
- orange : #f68773
- color banner top : #DFDFDF

### Our method:

We decided to go for a mobile-first approach as mobile is the most popular device. Mobile-first method also makes up for a faster download time and shortens the code significantly (which then allows fewer bugs). 
We used Sass as our preprocesser for CSS. 
François did the homepage and the mobile menu, Charlotte did the Shop page and the About page and Asceline did the Single product page and the Contact page.
